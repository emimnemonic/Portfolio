The [first version of my portfolio project](http://codepen.io/emimnemonic/full/JGjmeX/) was all right but I wanted to do a responsive, minimalist UI one-page portfolio theme with a fixed sidebar navigation menu.

As I've been trying to work with CSS preprocessers these days, I built this page with HTML and SCSS, which I do like a lot.

This page uses flexbox for the side nav bar, pure CSS masonry and [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/).

Feel free to use, fork, comment, provide tips on how I could code better etc :).
